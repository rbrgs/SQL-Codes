SQL CTEs

--What is the CTE in SQL?
--A common table expression, or CTE, is a temporary named result set created from a simple SELECT statement that can be used in a subsequent SELECT statement.
--Each SQL CTE is like a named query, whose result is stored in a virtual table (a CTE) to be referenced later in the main query
